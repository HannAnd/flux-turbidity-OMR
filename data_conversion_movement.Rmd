## Introduction

Data for this experiment was captured using cameras mounted vertically below
tanks to observe  the movement of zebrafish in shallow waters. The videos were
then processed using the automated tracking program TRex, which returns
individual files for each tracked fish for each video. Here, we are taking these
individual fish files and 1) converting the frame-by-frame data into summary
statistics for each video and 2) combining the data from the 500+ files into a
singular file. This file is used to export movement data. See
data_conversion_social.Rmd for the conversion of social and shoaling data. If
using one file after the other make sure to clear the working environment as
many variables are shared across files.


## Setup

For our experiments fish occurred in 4-fish groups, with two males and two
females per group.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

#setting the working directory
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = "D://Turbidity Flux Experiment with OMR/calibrated_CSVs")
library(tidyverse)
library(data.table)
library(zoo)
#the number of fish per group
fish = 4
#creating column names for each fish in the group
whichfish <- paste0("fish", 1:fish)
```


!!!!Phrasing below is a little confusing and will need to be updated besides

Setting up the code to be able to read in all of the files from a given
directory. We are also changing the "Inf" values TRex uses in place of NAs to
NAs and creating a master data frame to contain all of the summary statistics.

The definition of each variable in the original datafile is as follows:
"tankID" = The ID of the tank chamber.In total there were eight 20-gallon tanks
           divided into three evenly sized chambers each for a total of 24
           tank chambers. Each of these tank chambers was fully isolated from
           neighboring chambers so that no water passed through and shared walls
           were opaque white. The IDs of the tank chambers occur in an X-Y
           format, where X is the number of the overall tank and Y is the
           individual chamber within the tank.
"recording" = The recording number for that particular video. Recordings
               started at Recording 1 and ended with Recording 9. Recording 6
               was excluded from analysis due to being an unplanned extra set
               of recordings.
"mean_speed" = The mean speed of the group's collective movements. Excludes
               frames where the fish was not detected.
"activity_ratio" = The ratio of frames the fish collectively spent active versus
                   inactive over the course of the video. Fish were defined as
                   "inactive" if their speed was below XXX and "active" if their
                   speed was XXX and above. Excludes frames where the fish was
                   not detected.
"speed_variance" = The variance of the speed of collectively all of the fish
                   over the course of a single recording. Excludes frames
                   where the fish was not detected.
"max_speed" = The maximum speed any fish in a group reached over the course of
              a recording.

```{r file read in, message = FALSE}
#reading the file names into a list
list_csv <- list.files(pattern = "*.csv")
#from the list, creating a list of dataframes
masterlist <- lapply(list_csv, read_csv)
#importing the list of corner coordinates for each video
corners <- read_csv("D://Turbidity Flux Experiment with OMR/calibrated_corner_coordinates.csv")
#creating a dataframe to hold the final product
finalframe <- data.frame(matrix(ncol = 7, nrow = (length(list_csv)/fish)))
###this will need to change at some point###
colnames(finalframe) <- c("tankID", "recording", "mean_speed", "activity_ratio",
                          "speed_variance", "max_speed", "max_acceleration")
```

## Processing Files

The below code uses nested for-loops to process each of the datafiles and
eventually combine them into a single master file. For each video, TRex creates
a datafile for each detected fish- in the case of these experiments, that means
three or four fish per video (depending on the experiment). For analysis we are
lumping all fish behaviors across a group because individual identification is
impossible.

In this file we are extracting movement data. We do this by first processing the
X,Y coordinates of each fish into distances moved between frames. From the
distance values we then calculate for each video 1) total distance moved,
2) speed, 3) ratio of time spent active vs inactive and 4) acceleration.

Once these values have been calculated for each individual fish file
they are combined and summarized into a master datafile containing information
from all fish videos.

```{r loop, include = FALSE, message = FALSE}
i = 1
for (k in 1:(length(list_csv)/fish)) {  #across the whole file list
  #combining the files from all fish per video to be analyzed collectively
  shoal <- masterlist[i:(i+fish-1)]
  
  ##standardizing the length of each fish's file in a video so all files start
  ##at frame 0 and end at the last frame of the longest file
  #determining the last frame of a video by taking the largest frame value
  #from all of the fish datafiles

  #creating a dataframe filled with NAs to pad the missing frames from each file

                     X = NA, Y = NA)

    #adding NA rows from dfNA to start of file when it starts on a frame later
